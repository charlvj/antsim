# Ant Sim
My experiments in creating an ant simulator.

This started out as a test for a state machine framework in Java, and ended up being an experiment of simulating and ant and its colony.

The engine simulates the working of a simplified ant and an environment for it to live in. The result is an interesting experiment in population dynamics.

# Disclaimer
This is a hobby project in all forms of the word, with all sorts of incomplete ideas!

# Building
If you have maven installed, you can just do
  mvn build
to build the project, and
  mvn exec:java
to run it.

You can also open the project straight in NetBeans if you have it.
