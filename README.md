# antsim
My experiments in creating an ant simulator.

This started out as a test for a state machine framework in Java, and ended up being an experiment of simulating and ant and its colony.

The engine simulates the working of a simplified ant and an environment for it to live in. The result is an interesting experiment in population dynamics.
